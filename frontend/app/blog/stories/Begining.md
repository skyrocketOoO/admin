Life
From I become an SWE, I always ask a lot of questions, and try a lot of new things.
Most of them make me surprise!!

Trade off, a beautiful word, it tells me, in software engineering or more, there is not best solution, but better.

Why?

For instance, if we want to go to some place, we know that the plane has the best velocity, but, take a plain will cost more money, more time to check-in, ...etc.
In software engineering, a lot of design is to make sure the decoupling or flexibility, but it also increases the complexity.

So, it is 'Trade off', we must choose a better descision based on current environment.
This is all I start for, I was obsessed about those philosophy, why they design it, or this design can solve which problem, it's amazing!
