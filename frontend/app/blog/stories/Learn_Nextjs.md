# Nextjs is hard for newcomer of frontend
Nextjs design lots of technical and architecture to optimize, like SSR, ISR, client-server side...

It is flexible for building the optimized, static frontend or fullstack service, but also hard to learn.

So, if you are not familiar with basic concept about frontend(HTML, CSS, Javascipt), directly use nextjs will give you lots of frustration.

Don't do it like me, HAHAHA.
