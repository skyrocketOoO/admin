Software
Before I really use Go in work, I learned Go by myself and also Read something relative knowledge like TDD or clean architecture.
Most things seems beautiful!
They use a lot of philosophies like dependency injection to make all things clean, decouple, and testable.
But, when I really using in work, most project will not give you enough time to implement that. Even, we only use api test instead of unit test, integration test...etc.
That is what I really say: No one is best
