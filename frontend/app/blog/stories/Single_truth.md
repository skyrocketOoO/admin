# Problem
During my work experience, I've encountered several issues related to the principle of having a single source of truth:

1. Duplicated Data: Two different services store the same account information in their own databases. This can lead to data inconsistency when network connectivity is unavailable.
2. Redundant Data Columns: For example, a review item might have columns like OperatorID (UUID), Accept (boolean, with false as default), and Reviewed (boolean). If OperatorID and Accept are sufficient to determine the review status, having an additional Reviewed column introduces redundancy and inconsistencies.

# Benefit about single truth
The single source of truth concept means that each piece of data should be stored only once. For instance, in Scenario 2, using only OperatorID and Accept would be sufficient, making the Reviewed column redundant. By relying on OperatorID, you can determine the review status directly and avoid inconsistencies like Accept = true but Reviewed = false.

Single source of truth simplifies data management and ensures consistency, reducing the likelihood of encountering conflicting information.

# Should Everything Respect Single Source of Truth?
No, single truth make things simple and ensures consistentency, but it may not fit some cases like:

- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): These are used to improve availability and performance and might require data duplication across multiple locations.
- Readability and Performance: In some cases, having redundant data might improve readability or performance, making it easier to access or process certain information.

This is trade-off, I can't tell you which method is better because not all things have explicit answers. While single source of truth is a valuable concept, it's important to evaluate whether it fits your particular use case and weigh the benefits against potential drawbacks.
