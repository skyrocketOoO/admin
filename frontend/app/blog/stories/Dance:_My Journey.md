Dance
# Archeology
I have been dancing for 13 years, and my interest in dance has evolved over time. Each period has brought a different goal:

## For Coolness
During high school, my primary motivation was to be cool. This was the most intense period of my dance life. I practiced hard and danced aggressively during battles.

## Self-Doubt
One day, a senior told me, "I'm not sure you are a popper if you don't dance hit." This statement had a significant impact on me, causing me to question my style: "What do I want to be? What do I really want?"

## For Personal Style
At some point, I discovered something interesting: why do some dancers look so unique? When they dance, I can tell who they are without seeing their faces. This realization encouraged me a lot. I started dancing for my own style, regardless of whether it was popping, hip-hop, or something else.

## Dancing for Quality
What is quality? Have you ever felt that an action matches a sound perfectly? I can recommend some videos with dance, but don't watch them as dance—just move. For example, check out this video. Is it nice? Just a little bit of movement can fit any sound perfectly, giving me goosebumps. This is what I strive for now: "When I dance, I am music." When I hear music or sounds, a movie emerges in my mind, becoming my teacher.

## Contradiction
Despite dancing for many years, I have a problem. I always have a teacher in my mind, setting high standards for how I perceive dance. As a result, I rarely watch myself dance. No matter how good someone else thinks it is, I always find many flaws.

# Now and future
This is my journey. Now, I need to work, so I can't dance as often, but I will dance anytime—while walking, at home, everywhere. Because I love it.
