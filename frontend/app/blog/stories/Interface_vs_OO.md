Go’s design choices prioritize simplicity and concurrency, which is why it adopts interfaces over traditional object-oriented inheritance. Here’s a breakdown of why Go uses interfaces with structs and the pros and cons of this approach:

Why Go Uses Interfaces with Structs
Composition over Inheritance: Go emphasizes composition rather than inheritance, meaning instead of creating class hierarchies, functionality is combined by embedding types. This keeps code modular, straightforward, and reduces dependency chains.

Implicit Interface Satisfaction: In Go, any type automatically satisfies an interface if it implements the methods required by that interface, even without explicit declarations. This flexibility allows for cleaner, more decoupled code.

Encouraging Interface-Driven Design: Go encourages designing around behavior (interfaces) rather than types, which is more aligned with loosely coupled system architecture—especially useful for testing and dependency injection.

Pros and Cons of Interfaces in Go
Pros:
Simplicity: Code becomes more readable and easier to maintain without complex hierarchies.
Flexibility: By decoupling method requirements from concrete types, interfaces enable more modular and testable code.
Concurrency-Ready: With Go’s lightweight goroutines, struct and interface combinations better facilitate parallelism than traditional OO inheritance might.
Clear Contracts: Interfaces provide clear contracts for what methods are available, making the code easier to reason about.
Cons:
Limited Reuse: Without inheritance, there can be less code reuse for shared behaviors, requiring more effort to implement functionality in some cases.
Less Familiarity: For those with a background in OO languages, Go’s lack of inheritance might feel limiting or lead to code that doesn’t leverage Go’s idioms.
Boilerplate for Complex Applications: For very large applications, the lack of inheritance might result in some repeated code that OO languages could handle with shared parent classes.
Overall, Go’s design around interfaces and structs complements its focus on simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency, making it ideal for modern, high-performance applications, but it can be a bit unconventional for developers from OO backgrounds.
