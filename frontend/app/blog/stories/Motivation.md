# Why I start a blog?
- I want to learn English, so I want a blog to write something with English
- When I have something interesting thing want to share with others, I want to record it.
- Learning frontend
- This is also my resume

As I think, the most website like linkedin, cake, 104...etc, cannot completely show candidate's resume, especially for fresh.
## You get what you see
It's a cool thing, right?
