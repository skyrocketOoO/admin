# Why I choose Go with Nextjs?
In fact, I have learned a lot of languages.
- Python(ML), C, a little Java on my master
- Nodejs, a little Go, Python on my 1st job
- Python(automation) in 2nd job
- Python, C++, Go, at Leetcode
- Go, PHP in current job

As I even said, it doesn't have best choice, when I study in master, I always do algorithm and DSA optimizations compared with my classmates, it gives me more confidence and pleasure, so at that time, I focus on the low layer langage like C, C++, which has more flexibility for developers.

But for the job, we can't always write best optimize code or use low level language, we need to consider more and more factors like develop speed, learning curve, maintance...etc.

I will briefly explain the reason of my choice between those
## C(C++)
Dev slowly, steep learning curve, not fit for most fast-delivery jobs, but good to develop infrastructure
## Java
Compare with Go, has almost the same performance, but JVM memory cost may not fit microservices, and sometimes OOP is not required, and, the code is too long, like 
System.out.println...
## Python
Easily dev, test, but lots of syntactic sugar makes it hard to maintain, one developer one style, and its performance with GIL is not fit the sometging backend server.
## Nodejs
Its the second choice for me, because it is suitable for fullstack development, even though it using event-loop, but also has better performance for most IO-bound env.
## Go
Simplicity is beautiful, syntax consistency, static type maintainable, easily to do concurrent things, make me focus on bussiness logic.
## Vue
Simplicity, but less market share than React
## React
Market share better than Vue
## Nextjs
It is the fullstack framework, for simple environments, I can only use nextjs to do all, but also can combine with Go for high-resource demand
